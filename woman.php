                        The earth’s greatest need of the hour is the rising of the true king women. These are women of Israel who have internalised discovery of their origin, who they really are and the understanding of their divine responsibility in the world. They are identified with Christ, the Messiah. They have the spiritual understanding of the concept of the government of the kingdom of God.  They have discovered their purpose in God government and are making eternal impart for the kingdom. Their lifestyle and pursuit speaks volume of eternity. They are kingdom women because they possess the spirit of Kingship. And they live by the plan, will and purposes of Creator (Elohim) – The King of kings. They have a clear understanding of their role and responsibilities in the affairs of the kingdom here in the earth while guided by God’s principles. They are influencing their environment with Kingdom laws, discipling and teaching to observe all that Christ commanded. 

                        </p><p>Satan and his cohorts tremble and bow at their presence. They are God’s most dangerous weapon of peace in the earth but of war in the dark territories to snatch souls from the clutches of Satan. They are God’s strongest ally, best friends, lovers but Satan’s worst enemy. They bring many souls to the kingdom working in partnership with their heavenly Father. God is their treasure. Wherever they find themselves is their mission field. They see their sphere of contact which includes church, family, school, market, office, business arena, etc. as a chariot for fulfilling the kingdom business – their Father’s business which is also a family business. </p>
                        <p>The world might call them nothing but they are the ‘’True King Women.’’I call them ‘’true king women’’ because in the world today a lot of celebrities are regarded as king women using the world standard as benchmark. All the position and power in the world can make you famous and popular, and all the money and connections can make you rich and give you temporal pleasure but never a true king woman. A true king women pursue eternal goal which is the advancement of the kingdom of God in the earth. Within such women is a king. They possess the king’s spirit. They are extraordinary women. They are women on an eternal mission. They have sold all they have to purchase the kingdom of God. </p>
                        <p>Our homes are looking for such women who will impact their lives and instil in them the right values of life.  Our communities are looking for such women who would nurture and preserve lives for eternal relevance. Also, our larger society and nations are equally looking for these women who would change history. It’s obvious that Presidents of nations lack the ability to deal with their nation’s challenges. So many husbands are working out of their marriage for lack of virtues and values that build lasting marriage. Churches and other religious organisation are collapsing under the pressure of global civilization. Our children are growing up with less or no knowledge of biblical truth. This physical world has become an incubator of evil. Lack of these species of women is affecting the move of things the earth. My point is that the male man does not have the ability to take care of the earth alone. God said, man cannot do this work alone therefore I shall make him a help meet suitable for him. Of course, we can see but a few of them in our society. Where are the rest?Time is running out! There is still so much to do. The world waiting!</p>
